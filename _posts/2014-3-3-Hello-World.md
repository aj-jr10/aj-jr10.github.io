Earlier it was called the FIFA Ballond' or where the France Football magazine and FIFA temporarily merged their awards. Until 2008 when *Ronaldo* won both awards, the Ballond'or and FIFA world player of the year.

Now that FIFA and France Football have split their awards. We can now look forward to two gala's which decides who's the best player in the world. Of course, the debate will be there regarding which award has more integrity and prominence.

France Football announces a list of 30 nominees, deciding collectively based on their individual performance over a period of one year. The panel consists of 173 football journalists sore across the world. These pundits have the opportunity to rank three players.

Rank 1 holds 5 points, Rank 2 holds 3 points and finally Rank 3 merits a point.

These points are counted cumulatively and the player with the highest points is awarded the Golden Ball.

Unlike FIFA there's no gala as such, France Football magazine awards the player, the Golden Ball and conducts a small interview with the player.

Now that Cristiano won it last week, let's gear up to see who wins the FIFA best player of the year. FIFA have already shortlisted the top 3 nominees, Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, Griezmann. Will Cristiano edge again? Let's wait and watch.

Thanks a lot for reading :-)
