## Things to change in life

We have all been just lazing around in life without giving our true potential.
That's because we all want to be successful in life like wanting to ride a mercedes,
buying impressive houses, keep touring to n-number of countries. But we work very minimal and still want all this to happen.
Guys, I'm telling you nothing happens in this world without working your asses off day and night.
We are all just happy with short-term pleasures like going out and just chilling with friends, dating a girl/guy, texting a girl/guy. 
These are all just short-term happiness, nobody wants to, train harder, study harder and gain the highest GPA. Why don't we all find these things to be fun?
